    <h1>(Kinda) Rich Animation Demo</h1>
    <p>This is a demo I&#39;ve built within a fixed time frame of three hours. I tried reproducing
      the animations found on <a href="http://www.museapp.com">http://www.museapp.com</a> with Flutter.</p>
      <p>In my first approach I tried using the staggered animations package but it did not give me
      enough control over when to do what. So I decided to write my own animation controller
      which works but probably needs still some love to be viable.</p>
      <p>I also added a simple responsive Widget that accepts widgets for different container sizes,
      although it is probably not optimal yet.</p>
      <p>You can find the code for this example at <a href="http://github.com/MaximilianKlein/flutter_keyframe_animation_example">http://github.com/MaximilianKlein/flutter_keyframe_animation_example</a>.</p>
